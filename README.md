# challengeProject1

Hi there! My name is Chris. This project name is challengeProject1.

On this project I have been tasked with Debugging a webpage for Horiseaon Inc.
I will now list all of the Debugs I completed while working on this project.

<h2> Debugs: </h2>
<ol>
 <li>I updated the title of the webpage</li>
 <li>I uploaded an image file which had a section designated for it, but was not linked in. I then scaled the image to fit the browser page.</li>
<li>I added various id and class tags to consolidate some css coding</li>
<li>I restructured the HTML semantics removing uneccesary div tags and replacing them with section tags.</li>
<li>I fixed the #search-engine-optimization link to function as intended.</li>
<li>I added alt="" to all images and gave a brief description of each image.</li>
